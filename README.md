# Oasis Infobyte Internship Experience

I'm excited to narrate my adventure into the fascinating world of Data Science during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. Over this rewarding experience, I had the opportunity to partake in a variety of tasks that allowed me to delve into different areas and enhance my abilities in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
In Task 1, I immersed me into the realm of classification models by tackling the Iris Flower Classification challenge. Leveraging Python and Scikit-Learn, I embarked on a journey to build robust classification models capable of accurately categorizing Iris flowers into their respective species. Through meticulous data visualization techniques, I gained insights into feature relationships, paving the way for the implementation of machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.

### Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python
In Task 2, I presented a unique opportunity to delve into socio-economic analysis by focusing on Unemployment Analysis with Python. Armed with Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify trends and factors contributing to unemployment. By developing predictive models, I aimed to forecast future trends, contributing valuable insights to address this critical societal issue.

### Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
In Task 3, I ventured into the realm of predictive modeling with a focus on Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning techniques. Leveraging Python and its powerful libraries including Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy, I preprocessed complex datasets to explore feature importance and implement predictive models. Employing both Random Forest and Linear Regression models, I accurately predicted car prices based on multiple attributes, employing metrics like R-squared and MSE to refine and optimize predictions.

### Task 4: Spam or Ham Detection using LSTM Model
In Task 4, I explored the realm of natural language processing with a focus on Spam or Ham detection using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Utilizing Python and its powerful libraries, including TensorFlow and Keras, I preprocessed text data to prepare it for model training. Through the implementation of LSTM models, I effectively classified messages as either spam or ham. The evaluation criteria for this task included metrics such as R-squared (R²), accuracy, and loss, which helped in refining and optimizing the model's performance. This task allowed me to delve deeper into sequence modeling and enhance my understanding of deep learning techniques for text classification.

### Task 5: Buying Product Based on Prediction using Linear Regression Model
In Task 5, I delved into the practical application of predictive modeling for consumer behavior analysis, specifically focusing on predicting product purchases using a Linear Regression model. Utilizing Python and its robust libraries such as Scikit-Learn and Pandas, I analyzed various features influencing purchasing decisions. By preprocessing the data and implementing a Linear Regression model, I accurately predicted the likelihood of a product being bought based on historical data. The evaluation criterion for this task was R-squared (R²), which provided insights into the model's explanatory power and helped in refining the prediction accuracy. This task enhanced my understanding of how predictive analytics can be applied to real-world business scenarios to drive strategic decisions.
